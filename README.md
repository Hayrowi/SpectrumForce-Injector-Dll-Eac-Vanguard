- **Be careful when purchasing hacking cheats to avoid scams. More projects to come.**

- **To utilize the mapper seamlessly, incorporate the compiled binaries into your project. Consult the provided "Injection.h" header for comprehensive information. It's vital to have these compiled binaries located within your program's working directory. During the initial launch of the injection module, PDB files for both the native version of "ntdll.dll" and, when executed on x64, the wow64 version, are downloaded to resolve symbol addresses. To commence the download, employ the exported "StartDownload" function. Note that the injector can only operate once these downloads have been successfully completed. The injection module exports "GetSymbolState" and "GetImportState," both of which will return "INJ_ERROR_SUCCESS (0)" if the PDB download and the resolution of all essential addresses have been accomplished. Additionally, "GetDownloadProgress" is available to determine the download progress as a percentage. If, during the download process, you intend to unload the injection module, make sure to call "InterruptDownload" to prevent the potential deadlock of your process due to the DLL.**
